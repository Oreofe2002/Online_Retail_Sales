##Online Retail Sales Analysis & Customer Segmentation

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes transactional data from an online retail store to uncover:

Revenue performance trends

Top-selling products

Geographic sales distribution

Customer purchasing behavior

Customer segmentation using RFM Analysis

The goal is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights and an interactive Tableau dashboard for executive-level decision-making.

📊 Business Objectives

Identify total revenue and monthly revenue trends

Determine top-performing products

Analyze revenue contribution by country

Distinguish repeat vs one-time buyers

Segment customers using RFM analysis

Provide actionable marketing insights

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains transactional retail data including:

Ordert_ID – Order ID

Product_Code – Product Code

Product_Name – Product Name

Quantity – Number of units purchased

Order_Datetime – Date and time of purchase

Price – Price per unit

Customer_ID – Unique customer identifier

🧹 Data Cleaning Process

The following preprocessing steps were applied:

Converted Order_Datetime to datetime format

Removed cancelled Orders (Ordera starting with "C")
